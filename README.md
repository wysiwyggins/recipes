The Grand Grimoire of Potions - NaNoGenMo 2024 Submission

This project is a procedural generator that creates a potion recipe book titled "The Grand Grimoire of Potions" for NaNoGenMo 2024. The script generates a LaTeX document containing numerous potion recipes, each with unique ingredients, instructions, and effects.

to compile a copy of the book, make sure you have python installed, and run `python potions.py` from a terminal window view of the uncompresssed archive.

The reagents.txt word list has been scraped from multiple sources, each is demarked with a comment with links where available.
